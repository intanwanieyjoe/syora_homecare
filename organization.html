            Rumah Nurul Iman was established at the end of 2000 with the
            original name of Yayasan Nurul Iman.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>HISTORY OF ESTABLISHMENT</h4>
          <p>
            Rumah Nurul Iman was founded by Encik Khairul Anuar Bin Mohmad Razi
            (Former President). Established with the hope of helping
            underprivileged children such as orphans, the poor, the neglected
            and the oppressed, by providing shelter and the opportunity to get a
            perfect education.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In the early stages of its establishment, Rumah Nurul Iman was
            managed by a committee. The committee has appointed En. Khairul
            Anuar Bin Mohmad Razi as the Manager/Supervisor of the hostel. He is
            the person in charge of all matters relating to the operation of the
            hostel except in matters relating to assets and finances. For some
            reason in 2004 the operation moved to Jalan Intan, Kampung Dato
            Ahmad Said.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            At the end of 2005 again these children were moved, this time due to
            the failure of the Nurul Iman Foundation to fund the operating costs
            of the hostel and problems with the rented landlord. As a result of
            facing problems too often, then Mr. Khairul Anuar is determined to
            take over the full operation of the Nurul Iman Hostel from the Nurul
            Iman Foundation and its Committee.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This new settlement is located at Plot 359, Lorong Dato, Manjoi,
            Ipoh, Perak. The settlement only has a two -door rental house that
            is rented at a rate of RM 200.00 per month. With a meager personal
            income, En. Khairul Anuar had worked hard to operate the settlement
            with the help of the surrounding residents and the then Manjoi ADUN,
            YB Dato 'Haji Nazri. After trying hard to defend the fate of these
            orphans and poor children alone, including cooking and everything,
            then on October 9, 2006 Mr. Khairul Anuar has officially registered
            the Nurul Iman Orphans and Poor Child Care Center as a sole
            proprietorship. On the 12th of October, Mr. Khairul Anuar has made a
            sworn statement to confirm that the Nurul Iman Orphans and Poor
            Child Care Center conducts activities for free.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To expand the protection of orphans and the poor, In June 2010 En.
            Khairul Anuar has opened another Care Center (Branch) in Kampung
            Pinang, Kamunting, Taiping which accommodates only boys but was
            closed on 1st September 2016 due to lack of support.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            And on 30 June 2011 PERTUBUHAN KEBAJIKAN KASIH NURUL IMAN NEGERI
            PERAK was officially established under the Registrar of Societies.
            This establishment is to streamline the administration and fulfill
            the requirements of the Social Welfare Department.
